# PrestaShop Sample Module

The sole idea of this repository is to serve as a sample module for people looking to override Symfony routes and/or controllers in PrestaShop.

## How to Use

Simply copy the code to the `prestashop/modules` folder then go to `Back Office -> Modules -> Module Catalog` search for 'sk_test` and activate it. After that, navigate to `/adminXXXX/index.php/sell/orders/orders/` and it should work.
